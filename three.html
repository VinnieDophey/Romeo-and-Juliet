    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This is the third modified scene of the play "Romeo and Juliet" by W Shakespeare. All characters are older in age (adult age) and the play is in modern english, not shakespearian english. It is quite interesting and special to see all the characters at an older age, the same age that people would have gotten married today. NOTE: The Nurse is renamed to Charlotte <br> <br> In this scene, Lady Capulet propses to juliet a marriage with Paris, but Juliet denies this.</p>

        On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.<br>
