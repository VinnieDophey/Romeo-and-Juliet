    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This is the second modified scene from the play "Romeo and Juliet" by W. Shakespere. This has the theme of kids! Everyone here are little children and they all are around kindergarden age. <br> <br> In this scene, a kid was tasked to hand out invitations for a birthday party but cannot read. Therefore, he asks Romeo and Benvolio to read it for them. They realize that Romeo's crush, Rosaline, is invited to the party, so they decide to go.</p>

Also Juliet has been one of my only friends, she's someone who makes me laugh and cheers me up. But, if Juliet wants to have a playdate with you, she can. My birthday party is this weekend and I’ve invited the whole kindergarten class, and you can come too. Juliet will be there of course. You can get to know her.
