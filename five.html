    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This is the fifth and final scene in act one of the play "Romeo and Juliet" by W. Shakespeare. This version is modernized, meaning that slang and modern trends appear frequently in the script. Notice that the server's names are used sometimes instead of (number) server. Additionally, notice that there is a narrator instead of stage directions, a very unique take. <br> <br> In this scene, the Capulets are hosting a party and Romeo sneaks in with a mask. Tybalt recognizes Romeo's voice and gets furious, demanding to "beat him up". Romeo then falls in love with Juliet, and Juliet later learns that they are in rival enemy families.</p>
