    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This scene is the fourth modified scene of the play "Romeo and Juliet" by W. Shakespeare but it is in a future AI dystopian/utopia. The dystopian side is the Montague, where they are being oppressed by the AI and neurochips created by the Capulexerment, who lives in the utopian side. These two sides are divided by a massive wall that spans all the way from the cold north to the warmth of Verona. There is also a ceiling preventing one from climbing over the wall. This is an extremely unique take on "Romeo and Juliet" that has never been seen before! <br> <br> In this scene, Romeo and Mercutio has a heated discussion about if they should sneak over to the other side of the wall to rave in the Capulextron's party, or if they should stay. Romeo is fearful, as he had a nightmare about the "consequences yet hanging on the other side of the wall." At the end, they decide to let fate carry them and go to the party.</p>

        She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes<br>
        In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br>
        On the forefinger of an alderman,<br>
        Drawn with a team of little atomi<br>
        Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.<br>
        Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,<br>
        The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br>
        Her traces of the smallest spider web,<br>
        Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,<br>
        Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,<br>
        Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,<br>
        Not half so big as a round little worm<br>
        Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.<br>
        Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>
        Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>
        Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.<br>
        And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
        Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
        On courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;<br>
        O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>
        O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
        Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues<br>
        Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br>
        Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,<br>
        And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.<br>
        And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,<br>
        Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep;<br>
        Then he dreams of another benefice.<br>
        Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,<br>
        And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
        Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>
        Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon<br>
        Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes<br>
        And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br>
        And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
        That plats the manes of horses in the night<br>
        And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
        Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.<br>
        This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
        That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>
        Making them women of good carriage.<br>

The Capulextrons can also alter your memories, clearing your brain of thoughts to rebel against the Capulexerment. It digs into the deepest darkest secrets in your brain, even into the unconscious mind, the dream world. The Capulexerment alters brain after brain, scanning through memories and dreams of the Montague. It makes lovers dream of love, lawyers dream of money,  poor people dream of poverty. The neurochip is the lifeline of the Capulextrons, they stay up all night, all day, scanning, searching, and digging for information, for knowledge, for riots, for love, for rebellions, for fights, for deaths, for unconscious intrusive thoughts, for whatever they’re looking for.
