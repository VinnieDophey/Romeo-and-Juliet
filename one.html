    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This is the first modified scene from the play "Romeo and Juliet" from W. Shakespeare. This scenes has the theme of PIRATES! Everyone is speaking "pirate-y language" and wielding pirate weapons! <br> <br> In this play, a massive battle occurs with the Capulets who swung onto the Montague's boat. The High Admiral then gives them a warning, telling them that if a battle occurs again, they will be killed. Benvolio later learns that Romeo's love does not love him back, resulting in his sad mood. </p>
